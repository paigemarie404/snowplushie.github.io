As I make my way through the HTML and CSS section, it reminds me of my days on MySpace and how what I learned back in 2006 is helping me now with not only my education, but my personal blogs, as well.

I used to spend hours trying to make the perfect MySpace profile: fonts, background colors, descriptions, etc. My first profile  was a mess, with not only neon colors for the back, but for the text color, too. I eventually gave up and used a pre-made theme. 

Fast forward to Tumblr. I was determined to make my blog mine. I spent days editing a default theme code and I finally got it to look... like a blog. The background was solid black, my description was more than one line because of `<br>`, and I even changed the color of my header. I was very proud that I finally got the hang of Tumblr, and I'm still proud of that today.

The other day, I was talking to my boyfriend about when I was about 9 y/o, I used to think games were animated like the old cartoons until I accidentally found the code one day. I was so confused and scared that I didn't go into my files again! I though I broke something... until I signed into AOL and figured out that what I saw was code.

After talking to him, and going through these lessons, I've come to realize that I have always been interested in coding and creating things. I find it relaxing and simultaneously anxiety-inducing; being relaxed and on edge at the same time motivates me to solve problems and get my work done. It's why I love coding.
