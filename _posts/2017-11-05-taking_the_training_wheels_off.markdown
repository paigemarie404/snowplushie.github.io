This week, I made two majors strides: I set up a virtual machine (with some help) and I wrote HTML/CSS on my own! Here is my story.

It was a Tuesday night like any other, just reading, coding and listening to music… and then it happened. Something happened to the IDE and it wouldn’t let me submit my work no matter what I tried to do. So after about an hour of crying to my superhero of a boyfriend (his name is Chris), I calmed down and decided that I was going local.

Now, going local was something I was trying to put off for as long as possible; I read through multiple tutorials and it confused me and I just didn’t want to do it at this point in time, but I had to. I couldn’t deal with the IDE anymore, it’s too finicky and I needed something I knew I could do my work with little to no hassle.  So I swallowed my fears, pulled up Team Viewer, and Chris helped me set up the virtual machine and Ubuntu.

It took a few hours, but it was up and running… and then it wasn’t so the setup had to be redone. Once it was finally done, it worked! I installed everything I needed and I was on my way to bigger and better coding!

Let’s fast forward to today: Sunday, 3:00AM. I just got through the Zesty lab in Page Layout for HTML and CSS. Out of all the labs I’ve done so far, this one was not only the biggest challenge I have faced in coding, but also one of my greatest accomplishments.

When I read the description and it said I would be writing HTML and CSS code from scratch, I froze. All I could remember was my git commands and a few text elements. I thought this was it. Then I remembered the most beautiful resource: dev tools! I did what I could between the instructions in the source page and my notes, and the rest was done with inspecting everything on the mock-up so I could recreated like I was asked to.

I’m not going to lie, it took me about an hour to finish it once I got going. I made borders and margins and used ems and pxs, and then it was done. I wrote HTML and CSS from scratch. I would probably be more excited right now if I wasn’t still in shock that I actually did it.

I know once my astonished state fades and I truly appreciate what I accomplished, I will then become a bit cocky until I hit another bump in the road or get another error message and realize that I will always be learning when it comes to coding!
