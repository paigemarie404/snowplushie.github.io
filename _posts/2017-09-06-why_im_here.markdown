From the time I was born, we always had a computer in the house. My mother used it for her life coaching website, and my father used it for day trading. When I was about 2 years old, I joined in on the fun and excitement and was typing my name before I could even write it. From that point on, I was hooked. 

In my earlier years, I spent days learning the ins and outs of Microsoft Office as well as Windows 98, and 2000. I would click and hit every button I could get my hands (or cursor) on. I was absorbing information at a rapid speed and with every click, I discovered something new. It was like a treasure hunt for me.

I was also playing a ton of games; starting off with solitaire and memory games, I quickly moved on to Neopets, and the Nancy Drew point and click games. That's where my true love of problem solving came into play. From cutting wires so I wouldn't get caught by the bad guy, to switching signs around so no one could follow me, I became a master of not only problem solving, but analytical thinking, as well.

I absolutely love problem solving, so I decided that I was going to go to school for i̶n̶t̶e̶r̶i̶o̶r̶ ̶d̶e̶s̶i̶g̶n̶ ̶b̶u̶s̶i̶n̶e̶s̶s̶ ̶m̶a̶n̶a̶g̶e̶m̶e̶n̶t̶ ̶m̶a̶r̶i̶n̶e̶ ̶b̶i̶o̶l̶o̶g̶y̶ ̶p̶h̶a̶r̶m̶a̶c̶y̶ ̶t̶e̶c̶h̶n̶i̶c̶i̶a̶n̶ software development!

I was a software development major a couple of years ago, and my first course was Intro to Java. I was beyond excited to get started, so I immediately jumped in to the first lesson which was titled, “Hello, World!” This one assignment would change how I look at programming.

So, I open the prompt and I start writing the code. Everything is prefect: the one line of code had no typos or random characters, and everything should have run without error, right? Wrong. It wouldn't even run. I got no error messages, no pop-ups, nothing. So I decide to delete my work, and start again. I open up the prompt, write the code, hit the run button and now I have an error basically stating that there's a problem within the code. So I look at it, I re-write it, re-run it, and once again an error. I finally turned to Google and looked at how other people wrote the code. It was the exact same.

I decided to try one more time. I closed the program, reopened the prompt, type out the code, hit the run button, and it finally worked! A little window opened up with the words, “Hello, World!” written. From that point on, I knew that coding was going to be a huge challenge, and I've wanted to learn more ever since.

I love puzzles and trying multiple solutions on each problem I face. The challenges motivate me, and the relief that comes with getting no errors is like no other,  which is why I decided to learn software development.
