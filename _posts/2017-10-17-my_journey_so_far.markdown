As I reach the end of Intro to Ruby Development, there are a few things I have learned:

1. There will always be errors, no matter how much force you use on your keyboard.
2. When the screen starts to look blurry, it's time to take a break or go to sleep.
3. Bargaining doesn't work.
4. Screaming at the screen only works occasionally.
5. "Hello, World!" doesn't like me.

...oh yeah, and Ruby! I've learned the basics of coding in Ruby.

Over the past month or so, I have gone back and forth with my feelings for Ruby. Some days, I see it as a force of pure evil.

Other days, however, I love it. It can be a bit tricky at first, but once I started to understand what it wanted and how it wanted it, my despare slowly melted away and it was replaced with my love for puzzles and my determination to solve them. Plus, I'm pretty sure my boyfriend was tired of my waterworks every single time I would get a Syntax Error and was too stubborn to go to bed until I figured it out. I would like to take a minute to thank him... Hi Chris, thank you for putting up with me and my rage for hours on end!

One thing that I've taken away from the course so far is that it's okay to mess up, and even walk away from things for a while, as long as you don't give up and truly believe that the 27 examples and 26 failures aren't the end of the world... no matter how infuriating they are. 

I don't really have much else to say on the matter... oh, yes I do! If you have a cat, make sure to save your work and minimize your code before walking away from the computer or you will come back to a jumble of code and possibly irreparable damage to the lab you were working on (personal experience, thanks Coke)!
